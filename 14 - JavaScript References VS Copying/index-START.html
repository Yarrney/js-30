    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // here team is not actually a copy - but a reference to the original array, players.
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Frank';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    team2 = players.slice(); //slice does not affect the original array
    team2[2] = 'Michelle';
    console.log(team, team2);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team4 = [...players];

    team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Alex Arney',
      age: 21
    };
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    person2 = person;
    console.log(person, person2);

    person2.age = 28;
    console.log(person, person2);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 77 });
    console.log(person, person3);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
